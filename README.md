# Enlightenment
Enlightenment is a 1.12.2 Minecraft mod that provides a brand new experience to your Minecraft game.

This includes:

* New recruitable NPCs
* New Mana system using EXP bar
* New Mana Orbs and "Incinerate" spell
* New Nether boss

# NPCs
New Human NPCs will spawn all across your world. You can recruit Humans to be your follower by giving them Iron Ingots (similar to how Wolves are tameable using Bones).
Once recruited, Humans will follow you. You can command them to stay in one location by left-clicking them.

# Mana Orbs
Mana Orbs are items that will drop from all living creatures. If you right-click with this item held, you will receive one EXP bar per Mana Orb.

#Incinerate
Incinerate is another item that is only obtainable by defeating the new Nether boss, Ignis. This item acts as a fire spell. When right-clicked, it will fire a large fireball at wherever you look, costing one EXP bar. When right-clicked on the ground, it will cast fire. If you hit an entity with this spell, it will catch the entity on fire. Unlimited durability, but limited use depending on how much EXP you have. So don't lose it.

#Ignis
Ignis is the new Nether boss that only spawns in the Nether. It holds a humanoid form but acts like a blaze. However, don't take this mob too carelessly. Ignis has a large health pool, similarly to the Ender Dragon, and hits hard. This mob can also spawn anywhere in the Nether, so stay cautious during your travels.
